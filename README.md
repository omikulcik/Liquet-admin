#Liquet administration app

There is a test db set up in .env so feel free to try the app with:

Email: testuser@test.cz

Password: trymyadmin

##How to run it ?

cd in to the project directory in your console

run - ```npm run start```

##Information

The app is still in a development. There is no validation in the forms, so it may crash if you dont fill all of the fields properly.

I don't use redux in this app because it's state management is quite simple. Maybe I will implement redux later on.

This project was bootstrapped with react-create-app and uses firebase database and storage.

The admin app is not responsive yet because it is meant to be used on large screen devices.
